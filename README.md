# OSCP-Mass-Preparation

*This was made before I even started my OSCP course - the purpose of that was **(to 100%)**
eliminate the risk of revealing anything afterwards or during my journey into OSCP.

```
****************************************************************************
Because of this, I will not write anything about the OSCP - or anything that is OSCP-related 
during
or
afterwards
my OSCP course have begun.
****************************************************************************
```


*Removed some things as to not sound *too* confusing*
If you find any spelling mistakes, please **please** let me know! I'll fix it right away. (It does not need to sound nice!)

Note. This is for myself, so others *might* find this, or part of this repo - confusing.

Since this is my first OSCP for me, it's extra vital to be prepared.

Will include Notes, and research about Linux as well as Windows - and API's around them.



--- list of things to keep in mind ---


# Structure 1:

### [+] Effic. Work & Checkpointing

 - MultiTasking. (so, **never** actually **wait** for something to finish)
 - Before doing a oscp; Mess around with some things, asm, buffer overflows, kernel exploits, use-after-free's,
 - E.g take a malware (fanny.bmp in my case) mess around with it, see what happens in a debugger, etc. Perform some kind of, in-depth analysis too - as, in question how you would have made the malware, why and why not use (these) methods, etc. Shortly - explain Cons + Pros of different and identical approaches.
 - (As an academic exercise, how would one build a "better fanny.bmp" malware?)
