# OSCP-Mass-Preparation

Note. This is for myself, so others *might* find this, or part of this repo - confusing.

Since this is my first OSCP for me, it's extra vital to be prepared.

Will include Notes, Research(that - well, nearly everyone (Or, I at least) does before and, during OSCP, (labs and stuff))
around  Windows and Linux. "Quick"Scripts, (cmd,bash,...)

--- list of things to keep in mind ---



# Structure 1:

### [+] Effic. Work & Checkpointing

 - MultiTasking. (so, **never** actually **wait** for something to Finnish)
 - Record sessions **all the time.**
 - Before doing a oscp; Mess around with some things, asm, buffer overflows, kernel exploits, use-after-free's, 
 - E.g take a malware (fanny.bmp in my case) mess around with it, see what happens in a debugger, etc. Perform some kind of, in-depth analysis too - as, in question how you would have made the malware, why and why not use (these) methods, etc.Shortly - explain Cons + Pros of different and identical approaches.
